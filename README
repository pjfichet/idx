# Idx readme
##############

# Presentation
==============

Idx is an helper tool to make and to manipulate index files. Idx
has been made to automatically index troff document, but it can
also be used manually, to make an index of a book.

# Build
=======

To build and install idx and its manual page, run:

    make
    make install

To uninstall and clean, run:

    make uninstall
    make clean


# Compatibility with heirloom troff
===================================

Idx is needed by utroff-utmac to build indexes. In that case, if
heirloom troff is used, and if heirloom tools are in the begining
of the path, be sure that ’awk’ links to heirloom ’nawk’ and not
heirloom ’oawk’.

# License
=========

Idx and its man page are distributed under the ISC License.

# Help and bugs

Please, send bugs and patches at help at utroff dot org.
